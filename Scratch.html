       <h4>It's Learning Time!</h4>

       <p>Aloha! I’m Julia and I love art of all kinds! On this page, we’ll get to learn about a bunch of different types of art, and I’m gonna share some fun facts and food for thought about art.</p>

       <p class="box1">If you'd like to look at more art, take a look at my <a href="https://julialingenbrink.wixsite.com/my-site-3" target="_blank" id="Port" title="Portfolio of Poetry">Poetry Portfolio.</a></p>

       <ol>
           <li>Museums
               <ul>
                   <li>Art Museums are some of the best places we can go to appreciate art!</li>
                   <li>Not only are they a place of great inspiration, but also a place to learn history and observe artist’s techniques. </li>
                   <li>Art Museums are very important to me because ever since I was little. <br> My mom would bring my siblings and I to all kinds of museums. <br> 
                    Her motto was “There’s always something to learn”, and that fuels my passion for learning.</li>
               </ul>
           </li>
           <li>Jewelry</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Jewelry is an art form I picked up a few years ago, and I adore it!</li>
               <li>Something unique about making art with metals is its longevity–a well-made piece will last hundreds of years!</li>
               <li>However, the small size and application of jewelry allow us to keep art with meaning close to us.</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Glass</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Glass art will always be one of my favorite art mediums!</li>
               <li>From windows to vases to coasters, glass art is unique because of its transparency and ability to manipulate light.</li>
               <li>A fun fact: Did you know the main factor in determining glass price is color?</li>
               <li>It's because different colors require different elements to be mixed with the glass. For example, red glass has gold in it!</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Drawing</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Drawing is an amazing form of art, not only because of its wide applications but also because of its accessibility.</li>
               <li>From digital drawings to ink and paper, to cave walls, drawing is something anyone can pick up!</li>
               <li>In my opinion, drawings are most often a gift for someone. Handmade cards are the biggest example of this.</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Music</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Music is a very special art form because you don't need eyes to see it.</li>
               <li>Scientifically, people, plants, and animals react to music. For us humans, certain tones and melodies cause us to release dopamine. <br>
                For plants, calm instrumental music like classical or Guoyue increases their growth and strength.</li>
               <li>Music is also very important for culture. Every culture has a distinct sound and stories carried through music. <br>
                For example, My class sang the Hawaiian Mele: Na Kuahiwi Kaulana last year. </li>
           </ul>
       </ol>
